	<h2>Please note!</h2>

	<p>Sites added here is processed manually. This is because I'm no
	Nutch shark. If anyone knows how to build a automatic nutch daemon,
	please let me know how to do it.</p>

	<p>Pages are filtered by something in the url, which makes then
	identifiable to being a Wicket page.</p>

	<p>For example:<br />
	http://www.mail-archive.com/wicket-user@lists.sourceforge.net/<br />
	identifies that every url starting with this has something to do with
	the Wicket User mailing list.</p>

	<p>Therefor, please take your time, before submitting a site, to
	ensure find out whether the site contains more Wicket related items,
	which should be indexed and which could be indentified by the URL.</p>
